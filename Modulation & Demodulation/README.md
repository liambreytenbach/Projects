## Amplitude Modulation and Demodulation - Liam Breytenbach
**Last Updated:** 28 August 2025  

## Project Description
This project simulated amplitude modulation (AM) and demodulation in Julia, covering DSB-SC and DSB-LC cases with added band-limited Gaussian noise. Demodulation, noise analysis, and signal-to-noise ratio calculations were performed, demonstrating practical skills in signal processing and communications.
