## Wildlife Monitoring System - Liam Breytenbach
**Last Updated:** 28 August 2025  

## Project Description
This project involved designing and building a camera system, encased in a custom housing, to monitor Fork-tailed Drongos during twilight feeding. The system enabled remote observation of bird behavior and predation activity, providing an elegant solution for collecting ecological data in hard-to-access locations. My assigned role focused on the design and development of the housing submodule.
