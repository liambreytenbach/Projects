## Basic Fiber-Optics - Liam Breytenbach

## Project Description
This project demonstrated the use of basic fiber optics for data transmission using light. An STM microcontroller acted as the transmitter, driving an LED to send binary data. On the receiving end, another STM with an LDR detected the transmitted light signals and reconstructed the binary data. The transmitted information was the variable resistor value read by the transmitter, which was successfully sent and received via the optical link.
