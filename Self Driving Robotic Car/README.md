## Project Description
This project involved designing and building an autonomous mobile robot for a “treasure hunt” maze challenge. The robot was tasked to follow a line, detect objects at specified distances, and navigate to the closest object after locating all items. The project applied Mechatronics skills in design, prototyping, and subsystem testing, emphasizing autonomous navigation, sensor integration, and problem-solving.
