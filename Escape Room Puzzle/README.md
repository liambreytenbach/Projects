## Escape Room Puzzle - Liam Breytenbach

**Last Updated:** 28 August 2025

## Project Description

This project involved designing and building a puzzle for a new escape room, applying Mechatronics skills such as programming, circuit design, project planning, and testing. The final design featured an 8-player system using LED strips, rotary encoders, an Arduino Nano, and custom mechanical components. Players were required to spin their encoders quickly enough to raise and maintain their LEDs at a target height. Once all eight LEDs were held at the correct level, the puzzle unlocked the door to the next stage of the escape room.
