## FOC algorithm for a surface PM motor - Liam Breytenbach
**Last Updated:** 28 August 2025  

## Project Description
This project focused on the practical implementation of the Field-Oriented Control (FOC) algorithm for a surface permanent magnet (PM) motor. Using the provided machine parameters, standard PI controllers were applied for both current and speed regulation. The controllers shared identical proportional and integral gain constants, enabling effective and stable motor control.
